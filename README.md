# Project 32Bit

## Elevator Pitch

A platformer where you move faster while low on health, promoting a riskier playstyle with melee combat

## Theme

Lab in the 90s and you play as a creature trying to break out

## Mechanics

The lower your health the faster you move

The goal is to complete the level as fast as possible

So you will want to be as close to dying as possible without actually dying

With melee combat to further promote a riskier playstyle
